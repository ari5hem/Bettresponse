# Emergency-Disaster-response
Our model aims to solve the problems associated with Disaster mitigation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Enhancing Emergency Response Efficiency Through Real-Time Coordination and AI-Driven Insights

During emergencies, timely response and effective coordination between responders, authorities, and affected individuals are critical. However, traditional emergency response systems often suffer from delays, miscommunication, and lack of real-time data, leading to inefficiencies and potential loss of lives.

This project aims to develop an Emergency Response Coordination App that leverages real-time location tracking, AI-driven predictive analytics, and cloud-based communication to enhance response efficiency. The platform will facilitate seamless coordination between emergency responders, disaster management teams, and civilians by integrating live maps, automated alerts, and AI-powered insights to predict and mitigate risks.

By ensuring faster response times, improved situational awareness, and scalable infrastructure, our solution will help save lives and optimize resource allocation during critical situations such as natural disasters, medical emergencies, fires, and accidents
